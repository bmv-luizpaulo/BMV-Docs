## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 50, 70%, 50% (approximately #D1A329). The muted, warm yellow alludes to fields and land in a subtle way.
- Background color: HSL 50, 20%, 95% (approximately #FDFDF5). This near-white provides a bright and clean surface for content.
- Accent color: HSL 20, 70%, 50% (approximately #D15529). A bold complement to the primary hue, it brings focus and contrast for important UI elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, provides a modern, neutral, and readable typeface suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear and recognizable icons representing document types, status, and actions.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout that reflects the organizational structure and document hierarchy.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for status changes, document uploads, and report generation.
